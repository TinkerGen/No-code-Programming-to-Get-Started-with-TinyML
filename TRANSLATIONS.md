# Contribute by translating lessons

We welcome translations for the lessons in this curriculum!

## Guidelines

There are [**translations**](https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started/lessons/1-introduction-to-iot/translations) folders which contain the translated markdown files.

Translated lessons should follow this naming convention:

When translating the initial Readme, link the other translations to your translated readme and link yours to the main English Readme by using Shields as shown:

```markdown
[![Bengali](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bengali-blue)](translations/README.bn.md)
```
**README._[language]_.md**

where _[language]_ is a two letter language abbreviation following the ISO 639-1 standard (e.g. `README.es.md` for Spanish and `README.nl.md` for Dutch).

## Quizzes

Add your translation to the quiz-app by adding a file here: https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners/tree/main/quiz-app/src/assets/translations. Please don't localize the words 'true' or 'false' however. thanks!

## THANK YOU
